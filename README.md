# 👋 Nour Yasmine Sennoun – Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub! ❤️

I'm a recent MSc Data Science graduate with a strong foundation in mathematics, machine learning, and applied analytics. Here you’ll find projects that highlight my experience in working with data, developing models, and turning analysis into actionable insights.

## 🚧 What's Coming Soon

- **Cinema Visual Analytics Report**  
  - A business-focused visual analysis exploring operational trends across multiple cinemas, using Python and data storytelling to uncover seasonal and performance-based insights.

- **Machine Learning Examples**  
  - A regression model demonstrating preprocessing, training, and evaluation  
  - A short NLP demonstration (with data withheld to maintain confidentiality)

Most of the projects currently featured are based on academic coursework. Where possible, datasets have been anonymised and modified to reflect the structure and insights of the original data without compromising confidentiality. I am also working on new, independent projects beyond my degree to continue demonstrating my interests and building practical experience after graduation.

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, supervised learning, model evaluation
- **Visualisation**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Environments**: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab
